### Problem 1

I did the initial cleanup work using Google Refine. The JSON files that describe the transformations I did are in `data/google-refine`. I actually think the entirety of problem 1, transforming the data in this fashion, could theoretically be done in Refine, but I found Refine to be crashy for NUT_DATA-sized projects. The cleaned-up csv are in `data`: 

- `data/FD_GROUP.csv`
- `data/FOOD_DES.csv`
- `data/NUT_DATA.csv`
- `data/NUTR_DEF.csv`

`reformat_foods`

### Problem 2

`get_correlations`

### Problem 3

### Problem 4

### Problem 5

### Problem 6
